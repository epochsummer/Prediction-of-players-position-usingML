players_stats_by_season_with_position.csv – Final dataset containing player statistics along with position information. Filter.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook that merges multiple datasets to create the final dataset. Logistic_Regression.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook that applies Logistic Regression to predict player positions based on statistics. 

Logistic Regression: 
- Successfully used validation and test split Did scaling
- Used right logistic regression solver saga
- Added Regularization (penalty and l1ratio Drew the feature coefficient)
- Did the decision boundaries
- Used Regularizatin to prevent verfit and underfit


Accuracy: 1660 with feature 6 and got 63 percent Accuracy
